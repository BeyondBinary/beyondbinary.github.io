                <p>On March 1st 2015 Beyond Binary went public with an <a class="u" href="#">advisory</a> that disclosed 0day flaws in Seagate Business <a class="u" href="#">Storage 2-Bay NAS devices</a>. Days later, Seagate responded to the advisory through a number of channels:</p>
        
                <ul>
                    <li>A direct email to Beyond Binary.</li>
                    <li>A public announcement on their website.</li>
                    <li>An email to journalists who wrote news articles about the disclosure experience.</li>
                </ul>

                <p>The email that was sent to Beyond Binary was as follows;</p>

                <blockquote class="full-screen-sm">
                    <p>Dear OJ,</p>
                    <p>We appreciate your communication and willingness to work with Seagate in order to improve our products and ensure security for our customers.</p>
                    <p>We apologize that our communication did not result in a true collaboration and ultimately a timely vulnerability fix. We remain committed to our customer’s security and have taken action to develop a patch for download, which is expected to be available May 2015.</p>
                    <p>We have also provided our customers with the following article should they want to take immediate action to secure their products.</p>
                    <p class="text-overflow"><a href="http://knowledge.seagate.com/articles/en_US/FAQ/006133en?language=en_US">http://knowledge.seagate.com/articles/en_US/FAQ/006133en?language=en_US</a></p>
                    <p>We welcome continued work with you and are available should you have any questions.</p>
                    <p>[name redacted] Engineering Director [phone redacted]</p>
                    <p>[name redacted] PR Manager [phone redacted]</p>
                    <p>Best regards, [name redacted]</p>
                </blockquote>

                <p>This response is clearly lacking in detail compared to the response received by journalists:</p>
                
                <blockquote class="full-screen-sm">
                    <p>Hi [name redacted],</p>
                    <p>I wanted to share the below statement from Seagate following your recent query with regards to the zero day threat targeting Seagate NAS devices</p>
                    <p>‘After careful analysis, Seagate has confirmed that the vulnerability on our Business Storage NAS products is low risk and affects only those Business Storage NAS products used on networks that are publicly accessible via the Internet.</p>
                    <p>With factory settings, Business NAS products are not vulnerable. The user has to intentionally change a default setting to become susceptible.</p>
                    <p>All Business Storage NAS customers are encouraged to follow the instructions outlined in the article linked below to ensure the product is secure and inaccessible by an unauthorized third party. Additionally, Seagate recommends as a best practice that customers secure their internal network by implementing a firewall.</p>
                    <p>For those customers who choose to keep their networks open, Seagate will be issuing a software patch for download expected May, 2015.</p>
                    <p class="text-overflow"><a href="http://knowledge.seagate.com/articles/en_US/FAQ/006133en?language=en_US">http://knowledge.seagate.com/articles/en_US/FAQ/006133en?language=en_US</a></p>
                    <p>We encourage you to update your articles and would welcome additional questions.’</p>
                    <p>Thanks, [name redacted]</p>
                </blockquote>

                <p>It is not clear why the extra detail was excluded in the first email. However, what is clear is that both emails are attempting to control brand damage, and in down-playing the severity of the problem are misleading their customers.</p>

                    <li>An email to journalists who wrote news articles about the disclosure experience.</li>

                </blockquote>

                <p>This is incorrect. The ability to perform remote code execution on any device as the   root user, pre-authenticated, is not considered “low risk”. According to the CVSS 2 scoring system, this vulnerability achieves a base score of 10: (AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:C/I:C/A:C).</p>
